# Websmith

Websmith is an AI-powered project generator inspired by tools like Bolt.  
It analyzes a user’s idea and generates structured project setups (Node or React) with production-ready code and UI.

In addition to code generation, Websmith will include a **sandboxed environment** where users can **edit, run, and iterate on the generated code directly in the browser** using **Webcontainers**.


## Status
🚧 **Work in progress** — Sandbox and UI features are under development.
